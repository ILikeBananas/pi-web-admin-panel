# pi-web-admin-panel
## Introduction
This project is a open-source, live, modulable admin panel for servers or RPIs. The idea is to control all your services on a simple web page. Every service will be his own "box" with the color matching his current status. Everything will be synced by socket.io.

## Installation and starting
``cd client``  
``npm install``  
``npm run build``  
``cd ../server``  
``npm install``  
``npm start``
